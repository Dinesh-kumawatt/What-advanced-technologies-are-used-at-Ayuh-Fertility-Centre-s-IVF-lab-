When it comes to IVF, technology really matters. Itâ€™s not just about the doctor giving medicines or doing a procedure â€” itâ€™s also about how good the lab is. At Ayuh Fertility Centre in Ahmedabad, the IVF lab is built with modern tech and global standards that make a big difference in success rates.

First of all, the lab is fully equipped with high-end incubators. These are special machines that keep the embryos in the right temperature, humidity, and air balance â€” just like inside a motherâ€™s body. If even one condition goes off, the embryo might not grow properly. Thatâ€™s why Ayuh makes sure the environment is tightly controlled using HEPA filters and air purifiers, so everything stays clean and safe.

They also use ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection), which is very useful when the sperm count is low or the sperm canâ€™t swim properly. In ICSI, one good sperm is directly injected into an egg using a micro-needle. It needs skill and proper equipment, which Ayuh has. This tech helps many couples who have failed IVF attempts before.

Another cool thing is their use of time-lapse embryo monitoring. This machine takes continuous photos of embryos while they are growing, so doctors can select the healthiest one for transfer. This way, they donâ€™t need to take embryos out of the incubator again and again. That helps maintain their quality and increases the chance of pregnancy.

Ayuh also offers embryo freezing using vitrification, which is an advanced way to freeze eggs and embryos quickly without forming ice crystals. Frozen embryos are helpful if the couple wants to delay pregnancy or try again in future cycles. Many couples come back to use their frozen embryos after a few months or even years.

Lastly, the clinic also does blastocyst transfers, which means transferring embryos after 5 days of growth instead of 3. These embryos are usually stronger and more likely to implant. But not all clinics can grow embryos to this stage, because it requires a really good lab and team.

So yeah, Ayuh Fertility Centre is not just about doctor consultations. Their lab plays a huge part in helping couples become parents. Itâ€™s well-maintained, highly equipped, and managed by trained embryologists.
